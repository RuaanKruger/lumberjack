# LOG002

Avoid trailing period in messages, because log messages are fragments, not sentences.

## Incorrect usage
```csharp
public class MyTest 
{
    public MyTest(ILogger logger) { 
        logger.LogDebug("This is a sentence and violates our rule.");
    }
}
```

## Correct usage
```csharp
public class MyTest 
{
    public MyTest(ILogger logger) { 
        logger.LogDebug("This is a sentence that doesn't");
    }
}
```
