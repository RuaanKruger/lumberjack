# LOG001

Prefer extension method over Log(Level...)

:angry: Some members of my team felt really strongly about this one.

## Incorrect usage
```csharp
public class MyTest 
{
    public MyTest(ILogger logger) { 
        logger.Log(LogLevel.Information, "See, now we have to supply a log level");
    }
}
```

## Correct usage
```csharp
public class MyTest 
{
    public MyTest(ILogger logger) { 
        logger.LogDebug("Awesome Sauce");
    }
}
```
